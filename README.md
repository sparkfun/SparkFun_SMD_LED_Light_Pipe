The [SparkFun SMD LED Light Pipe](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/25893) is a 5mm plastic lens and housing for mounting SMD LEDs in a 90Â° board edge configuration. Commonly used for circuit board indicators (CBI). Circuit board indicators should be any color and take only one GPIO to control them all!
